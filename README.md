# µHome - A Home Managing and Automation Service

Microservice Based Home Managing and Automation Service

## Brainstorming

Surely there are tons of other ready-to-go microservices frameworks with already built-in service registries and what not.
This project purely is for learning something new, while also implementing something of value for myself.

My idea is a service/product/app (call it the frick you want) that contains some features managing my home (or even automate some stuff)
Easiest use case I could think of right now, is a simple storage/state service, that keeps track of food/drink at home (and maybe when I have opened them).

There may come other stuff in my mind, which implies a scalable and modular architecture.
Therefore I want to go and try implement a "kinda full-blown" microservice event-driven architecture myself.

I'll start with an centralized event broker.
But maybe one day I'll try and restart using a decentralized architecture.
